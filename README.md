## Introduction

Calculating the coeï¬€icients of the Riemann mapping function for the exterior of the Mandelbrot set to the closed unit disk.



## Compute Coefficients

To compute am and bm coefficients of the Laurent series of the Riemann mapping function, use **codes/coeff_compute.py**

For example, to compute the first 7168 coefficients for both am and bm

```
$ python codes/coeff_compute.py --max_power 7168
```
